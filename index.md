# Osman Faruk Bayram 

This is my personal website. I am too lazy to learn HTML/CSS/JS, so I am using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate this website. It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I know it is not the best solution, but it is the easiest one for me. Because i want to give my full focus on my research and education, not on the website.
